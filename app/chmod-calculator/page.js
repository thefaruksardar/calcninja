        <h2>Understanding File Permissions in Linux</h2>

        <p>
          Before delving into the features of linux permissions calculator, it's
          essential to grasp the basics of file permissions in Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Linux operating system, each file and directory is assigned a
          set of permissions that determine who can read, write, and execute
          them.
        </p>

        <p>
          These permissions are represented by three sets of characters: owner,
          group, and others, denoted as r (read), w (write), and x (execute).
        </p>

        <p>
          Traditionally, setting permissions involves using the{" "}
          <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod" target="_blank">
            chmod command
          </Link>
          followed by a numeric code or a symbolic representation to specify the
          desired permissions.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this method is effective, it can be daunting for users who are
          not accustomed to working with the command line.

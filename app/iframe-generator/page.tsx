          specifying how tall and wide it should appear on your webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          By customizing the height and width, you ensure that the embedded
          content fits seamlessly within your website layout, avoiding any
          awkward overlaps or misalignments.
        </p>
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>
          With this feature, you can add a border around your iframe, enhancing
          its visual appearance and giving it a more polished look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Borders help to define the boundaries of the embedded content, making
          it stand out within your webpage.
        </p>
        <h3>Border Type & Color</h3>
        <p>
          This feature provides further customization by allowing you to choose
          the type (such as solid, dashed, or dotted) and color of the border
          surrounding your iframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          By matching the border type and color to your website's aesthetics,
          you can ensure a cohesive and harmonious design.
        </p>
        <h3>Margin Height & Width</h3>
        <p>
          Margin height and width refer to the spacing around your iframe. This
          feature enables you to fine-tune the margins, adjusting the amount of
          space between the iframe and surrounding elements on your webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          By optimizing the margin height and width, you can achieve an optimal
          presentation of the embedded content.
        </p>
        <h3>Scroll & Fullscreen</h3>

          You can choose whether users can scroll within the iframe to view
          additional content and whether they can expand the iframe to
          fullscreen mode for a more immersive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          These options offer flexibility in how users interact with the
          embedded content, enhancing usability and accessibility.
        </p>
        <h3>Preview</h3>
        <p>
          This feature allows you to instantly preview the generated iframe code
          within the tool itself. By previewing the code, you can see how the
          iframe will appear on your webpage, ensuring it looks just right
          before embedding it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This real-time previewing saves time and effort by allowing you to
          make any necessary adjustments before finalizing the code.
        </p>
        <h3>Copy Code</h3>
        <p>
          With a simple click, you can copy the generated iframe code to your
          clipboard. This makes it easy to transfer the code to your website's
          HTML, as you can simply paste it wherever{" "}
